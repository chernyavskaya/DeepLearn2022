# DeepLearn2022
Tutorial on graph neural networks taught at [DeepLearn 2022 Autumn](https://irdta.eu/deeplearn/2022au/blog/speakers/nadya-chernyavskaya/), 7th International School
on Deep Learning. 


"Graph Networks for Scientific Applications with Examples from Particle Physics", level - intermediate.

### Summary
In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have acquired enormous popularity thanks to their elegant applicability and handling of non-structured data in graph related problems. In particle physics, in particular, GNNs have been shown to achieve excellent performance for many different tasks, such as jet tagging (graph classification), anomaly detection (out-of-distribution detection) and particle generation (point-cloud generation). In this workshop, I will first give an introduction to the GNNs and cover the recent advances in the field. During the practical part, participants will first learn how to implement a graph convolutional neural network from scratch in Pytorch. In the second part of the practical demonstration, I will show how to implement a GNN for jet tagging at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN using a modern Pytorch-Geometric library. I will also cover the computational overheads that are common for GNNs, and how to overcome them.
